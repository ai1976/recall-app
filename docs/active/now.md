# NOW - Current Development Status

**Last Updated:** 2026-03-06
**Current Phase:** Feature: Course-aware browsing

---

## Just Completed ✅

### UX: Browse Notes pagination refactor — subject-first with View All (Mar 6, 2026)
Replaced confusing note-count "Load More" with subject-accordion-first layout. All subjects collapse by default so users see the full subject list at a glance. Topics >6 notes show 6 inline + "View all X notes →" navigating to `?subject=X&topic=Y`. BrowseNotes now reads `topic` from URL params and syncs filter state on URL change (for within-page "View all" navigation).

**Files changed:**
- `src/pages/dashboard/Content/BrowseNotes.jsx`

---

### Bug Fix: RPC ambiguous column "id" in course-aware browsing (Mar 6, 2026)
Both `get_browsable_decks` v3 and `get_browsable_notes` v3 threw PostgreSQL error 42702 ("column reference 'id' is ambiguous") because both are declared as `RETURNS TABLE(id UUID, ...)` — making `id` both an output column (PL/pgSQL variable) and the column referenced in `WHERE id = v_user_id`. Fixed by qualifying as `WHERE profiles.id = v_user_id` in both functions.

**Files changed:**
- `docs/database/study-groups/29_FUNCTION_get_browsable_decks_v3.sql` — `WHERE profiles.id = v_user_id`
- `docs/database/study-groups/30_FUNCTION_get_browsable_notes_v3.sql` — same fix

### Feature: Course-aware browsing for students (Mar 6, 2026)
Students were seeing content from all courses on the Review Flashcards and Browse Notes pages. The RPCs had no course gate — they only enforced visibility (public/friends/groups/own). Added a course gate to both RPCs and locked the Course filter dropdown for students.

**SQL (run in Supabase SQL Editor in order):**
- `28_SCHEMA_composite_course_user_indexes.sql` — composite indexes on `(target_course, user_id)` for both tables
- `29_FUNCTION_get_browsable_decks_v3.sql` — updated RPC with course gate
- `30_FUNCTION_get_browsable_notes_v3.sql` — updated RPC with course gate

**Logic:**
- Professors/admins/super_admins: bypass course gate, see all courses
- Students: see content where `target_course = their course_level` OR they are the author
- Course dropdown: locked (disabled) for students with label "(Current Syllabus)", free for professors
- Empty states distinguish "no content for your course yet" vs "no results match your filters"
- `clearAllFilters` does not reset the course for students

**Files changed:**
- [x] `docs/database/study-groups/28_SCHEMA_composite_course_user_indexes.sql` — NEW
- [x] `docs/database/study-groups/29_FUNCTION_get_browsable_decks_v3.sql` — NEW
- [x] `docs/database/study-groups/30_FUNCTION_get_browsable_notes_v3.sql` — NEW
- [x] `src/pages/dashboard/Study/ReviewFlashcards.jsx` — profile fetch, locked dropdown, empty states
- [x] `src/pages/dashboard/Content/BrowseNotes.jsx` — same

### Fix: "My Cards" pinned option in Author dropdown (Mar 5, 2026)
Students with only private flashcard decks were invisible in the Author filter (the RPC `get_filtered_authors_for_flashcards` only returns authors with public decks). Added a hardcoded "My Cards (Private & Public)" option pinned at the top of the Author dropdown using `user.id` as the value. No DB changes required — compatible with existing StudyMode `authorParam` filter and SRS two-step query (student's own private cards are already fetched via the visibility `user_id.eq.${user.id}` OR clause).
- [x] **`ReviewFlashcards.jsx`** — Added pinned `<SelectItem value={user.id}>My Cards (Private & Public)</SelectItem>` after "All Authors", before dynamic RPC-sourced authors list.
- [x] **`StudyMode.jsx`** — No changes needed; `authorParam` filter already handles any UUID including the current user's ID.
- [x] **Empty state** — Already handled: StudyMode shows "No flashcards to study" with "Choose Different Subject" button when card list is empty after all filters applied.
- [x] **`docs/tracking/changelog.md`** — Entry added.
- [x] **`docs/tracking/bugs.md`** — Bug entry added.

### Fix: Author mixing + SRS-aware session in StudyMode (Mar 5, 2026)
Student reported: studying a professor's deck also showed the student's own cards mixed in; no way to pause mid-session and resume sensibly.
- [x] **`ReviewFlashcards.jsx`** — `startStudySession()` now passes `author` URL param when a specific author is selected in the filter. "Study All" and per-deck study both respect the active author filter.
- [x] **`StudyMode.jsx`** — Reads `authorParam` from URL and filters cards client-side (`card.user_id === authorParam`), scoped on top of the existing visibility fetch.
- [x] **`StudyMode.jsx`** — Added SRS-aware two-step query (LEFT JOIN equivalent): after fetching matching cards, fetches `reviews` records for this user and excludes cards where `status = 'suspended'`, `next_review_date > today`, or `skip_until > today`. First-time cards (no review record) pass through — no cold-start problem.
- [x] **`docs/tracking/changelog.md`** — Entry added.
- [x] **`docs/tracking/bugs.md`** — Bug entries added.

### Fix: Course→Subject cascade filter in Study section (Mar 4, 2026)
Both Review Flashcards and Browse Notes pages showed all subjects in the Subject dropdown regardless of Course selection. Selecting "CA Foundation" showed subjects from all courses.
- [x] **`ReviewFlashcards.jsx`** — Added `allSubjectsFromDecks` state (array of `{name, course}`) populated at fetch time. New `useEffect` filters `availableSubjects` when `filterCourse` changes; auto-resets `filterSubject` if selection no longer valid (which cascades to reset topics via existing effect).
- [x] **`BrowseNotes.jsx`** — Same fix with `allSubjectsFromNotes`.
- [x] **`docs/tracking/changelog.md`** — Entry added.
- [x] **`docs/tracking/bugs.md`** — Bug entry added.

### DB Trigger Fix: flashcard_decks auto-creation on bulk upload (Mar 2, 2026)
Root cause: `update_deck_card_count()` trigger only ran `UPDATE card_count` on existing deck rows. When flashcards were bulk-uploaded (or uploaded via any path that didn't pre-create a deck row), no deck row existed yet — the UPDATE matched 0 rows, silently did nothing, and no `flashcard_decks` entry was ever created. Result: flashcards were invisible in Study Page (Course filter, deck list) and Author Profile.
- [x] **DB** — Replaced `UPDATE` in trigger with UPDATE-then-INSERT pattern: tries to increment existing deck; if `NOT FOUND`, inserts a new deck row with `card_count = 1`, `target_course`, and `visibility` copied from the flashcard. Permanent fix — covers all insertion paths for all future courses automatically.
- [x] **DB (data fix)** — Backfilled missing `flashcard_decks` rows for CA Foundation flashcards already in `flashcards` table. Card counts set from actual row counts, visibility set to most permissive found among cards in each subject/topic group.
- [x] **`docs/tracking/changelog.md`** — Entry added with root cause.
- [x] **`docs/tracking/bugs.md`** — Bug entry added.
- [x] **`docs/reference/DATABASE_SCHEMA.md`** — `update_deck_card_count` function doc updated.

### Performance: App Load Time Fix (Feb 24, 2026)
Root cause: entire JS bundle (all 55 pages) downloaded on first load, plus two sequential Supabase auth calls blocking render.
- [x] **`App.jsx`** — Converted all page imports to `React.lazy()`. Pages now download on-demand (only the current route).
- [x] **`App.jsx`** — Extracted `AppContent` component that reads auth from `useAuth()`. Eliminated the duplicate `supabase.auth.getSession()` call that was running in parallel with AuthContext's own call.
- [x] **`App.jsx`** — Wrapped `<Routes>` in `<Suspense>` with spinner fallback.
- [x] **`AuthContext.jsx`** — Removed `{!loading && children}` blocking gate (AppContent now owns the loading spinner). Removed 30+ debug `console.log` statements from `signIn`.
- [x] **`vite.config.js`** — Added `manualChunks` to split vendor-react, vendor-supabase, vendor-radix into separate cacheable chunks.
- [x] **`index.html`** — Added `<link rel="preconnect">` for Supabase URL to reduce auth latency.
- [x] **`src/hooks/useOCR.js`** — Deleted dead code (never imported anywhere, was pulling in tesseract.js).



### Egress Optimisation: Flashcard Image Storage Fix + Migration (Feb 22–23, 2026)
Root cause: 167 flashcard images (110 MB) stored as raw base64 TEXT in DB columns — every study session downloaded the full blobs from the database.
- [x] **`FlashcardCreate.jsx`** — Replaced `FileReader.readAsDataURL` (base64 → DB) with async compress + Storage upload pipeline. `imageCompression` (same settings as NoteUpload: `maxSizeMB: 0.2, maxWidthOrHeight: 1200`) → upload to `flashcard-images` Storage bucket → store public URL in DB. EXIF-safe via `browser-image-compression`.
- [x] **`FlashcardCreate.jsx`** — Card state shape changed: `frontImage/backImage` (base64) → `frontImageUrl/frontImagePreview/backImageUrl/backImagePreview` (URL + ObjectURL).
- [x] **`FlashcardCreate.jsx`** — Per-card upload spinner (`uploadingImage` state tracks `{ index, side }`). Label shows "Change Image" after upload. ×-button on preview to remove image. ObjectURLs revoked on card removal (memory leak prevention).
- [x] **Migration completed 23 Feb 2026 06:55 AM** — 167 images migrated, 0 failed. All base64 blobs removed from DB and uploaded to `flashcard-images` Storage bucket under `migrated/` prefix.
- [x] **`MigrateFlashcards.jsx` deleted** — temporary admin page removed after successful migration. Route removed from `App.jsx`.
- [x] **Build verified clean** — 1975 modules, 5.64s, no errors.

### Egress Optimisation: Lazy Loading + Load More + Image Compression (Feb 22, 2026)
Root cause: 14+ GB Supabase egress from 26 users — all note images loading at full resolution simultaneously.
- [x] **`BrowseNotes.jsx`** — Added `loading="lazy"` + `decoding="async"` to all note `<img>` tags. Off-screen images no longer fetched on page load (~90% egress reduction).
- [x] **`BrowseNotes.jsx`** — Added `bg-gray-100` to image button wrapper as CLS placeholder (grey box visible while images load — prevents layout shift).
- [x] **`BrowseNotes.jsx`** — Added `NOTES_PER_PAGE = 10` constant + `visibleCount` state. Render computes `flatFiltered` → slices → regroups via existing `groupNotesBySubject()`. Only 10 notes rendered in DOM on load.
- [x] **`BrowseNotes.jsx`** — "Load More" button appends next 10 notes. `visibleCount` resets to 10 on any filter change. Groups remain intact (new notes tuck into existing headers — no fragmented group split across pages).
- [x] **`NoteUpload.jsx`** — Imported `browser-image-compression` (already installed v2.0.2). Made `handleFileChange` async.
- [x] **`NoteUpload.jsx`** — Images compressed client-side before upload: `maxSizeMB: 0.5`, `maxWidthOrHeight: 1920`, `useWebWorker: true`. Handles EXIF rotation automatically (iPhone portrait photos stay upright). Fallback to original file if compression throws. (Limits raised from 0.2/1200 to preserve readability of text-heavy mindmaps and diagrams.)
- [x] **`NoteUpload.jsx`** — `compressing` state: label gains `cursor-wait opacity-75` + `htmlFor` unlinked during compression (prevents double file picker open). Spinner shown in upload area with "Compressing image…" text.
- [x] **`NoteUpload.jsx`** — Updated upload hint text: "JPG, PNG (auto-compressed to ~500KB) or PDF (max 10MB)".
- [x] **Build verified clean** — 1974 modules, 5.42s, no errors.

### Push Notifications — Review Reminders Cron (Feb 23 + Mar 5, 2026)
- [x] **`supabase/functions/cron-review-reminders/index.ts`** (NEW) — Scheduled Edge Function that fires daily at 08:00 IST (02:30 UTC) via pg_cron. Queries `reviews` table for cards with `status = 'active'`, `next_review_date <= today`, and `skip_until IS NULL OR <= today` — exactly matching Dashboard.jsx due-card logic. Aggregates count per user, checks `push_notification_preferences.review_reminders`, sends one push per user. Fixed tag `review-reminder` (browser replaces instead of stacking). Auth via `x-cron-secret` header.
- [x] **Deployed** to project `ztxguiujzirburxpjujf` via `npx supabase functions deploy cron-review-reminders`.
- [x] **`CRON_SECRET`** set in Supabase secrets (32-byte random hex).
- [x] **pg_cron job registered** — `daily-review-reminders` at `30 2 * * *` (active = true, confirmed via SQL).
- [x] **Fix: JWT verification disabled** (Mar 5) — Supabase "Verify JWT with legacy secret" was ON by default, blocking pg_cron calls with HTTP 401 before function code ran. Turned OFF in Edge Function Details tab. Auth is handled by `x-cron-secret` header inside the function. Manually tested and confirmed delivery after fix.

### Push Notifications — P1 PWA Foundation + P4 Frontend Wiring (Feb 22, 2026)
- [x] **`public/site.webmanifest`** — Fixed `name`, `short_name`, `theme_color` (#4f46e5), `start_url: /dashboard`, `purpose: maskable` on 512px icon.
- [x] **`public/sw.js`** — Service worker: handles `push` event (shows notification, respects `renotify`/`silent` flags), `notificationclick` (focuses existing tab or opens `/dashboard`), `install`/`activate` with `skipWaiting` + `clients.claim`.
- [x] **`src/main.jsx`** — Registers `/sw.js` on `window load` event (non-blocking, doesn't delay first render).
- [x] **`src/lib/notifyEdge.js`** — Fire-and-forget helpers `notifyContentCreated()` and `notifyFriendEvent()` that call the deployed Edge Functions. Never block the primary user action.
- [x] **`src/hooks/usePushNotifications.js`** — Hook: detects browser support, iOS + standalone status, current permission, existing subscription. Exports `subscribe()` (requests permission → subscribes → POSTs to push-subscribe), `unsubscribe()`, `needsIOSInstall`.
- [x] **`src/components/notifications/PushPermissionBanner.jsx`** — One-time dismissible banner on Dashboard. Android/desktop: "Enable" button. iOS + not installed: "Add to Home Screen" guide. Permission denied: hidden. Dismissed permanently via `localStorage`.
- [x] **`src/pages/Dashboard.jsx`** — Added `<PushPermissionBanner />` just above the main content grid.
- [x] **`src/pages/dashboard/Profile/ProfileSettings.jsx`** — Added "Push Notifications" card at bottom. Shows: enable button (default) / enabled + disable button (subscribed) / install prompt (iOS) / browser settings message (denied) / unsupported message.
- [x] **`src/pages/dashboard/Content/NoteUpload.jsx`** — Calls `notifyContentCreated()` after successful note insert (only for `public`/`friends` visibility). Fire-and-forget.
- [x] **`src/pages/dashboard/Content/FlashcardCreate.jsx`** — Calls `notifyContentCreated()` after successful flashcard create (only for `public`/`friends` visibility). Fire-and-forget.
- [x] **`src/pages/dashboard/Friends/FindFriends.jsx`** — Calls `notifyFriendEvent('friend_request')` after successful send.
- [x] **`src/pages/dashboard/Profile/AuthorProfile.jsx`** — Same as FindFriends for the Add Friend button.
- [x] **`src/pages/dashboard/Friends/FriendRequests.jsx`** — Calls `notifyFriendEvent('friend_accepted')` after accept, notifying the original sender.
- [x] **`src/components/layout/FriendsDropdown.jsx`** — Same accept notification from the nav dropdown quick-accept.
- [x] **Build verified clean** — 1973 modules, 5.68s, no errors.

### Push Notifications — Phase 3: Edge Functions (Feb 22, 2026)
- [x] **`supabase/functions/_shared/supabaseAdmin.ts`** — Shared service-role Supabase client for all Edge Functions. Bypasses RLS; never sent to browser.
- [x] **`supabase/functions/_shared/sendPush.ts`** — VAPID-configured web-push utility. `sendPushToUsers(userIds[], payload)` fetches all active subscriptions, sends concurrently, auto-deactivates expired (HTTP 410/404) subscriptions in one batch UPDATE.
- [x] **`supabase/functions/push-subscribe/index.ts`** — Saves device subscription (`endpoint, p256dh, auth`) via upsert on `(user_id, endpoint)` conflict key. Creates default `push_notification_preferences` row (all opted-in) if missing.
- [x] **`supabase/functions/push-unsubscribe/index.ts`** — Soft-deletes subscription (`is_active = false`) when user revokes permission. Preserves row for debugging.
- [x] **`supabase/functions/notify-friend-event/index.ts`** — Instant (non-aggregated) notification for `friend_request` and `friend_accepted` events. Checks push prefs, INSERTs notification row, sends push with `renotify: true`. Tag = `friend-{actor_id}`.
- [x] **`supabase/functions/notify-content-created/index.ts`** — Main update-in-place aggregator. 4-hour grouping window per `(creator_id, content_type)` pair. Professor public uploads → `professor_content` type → notifies all students with matching `course_level`. Student/friend uploads → `friend_content` type → notifies accepted friends only. Bulk-INSERTs new notifications; individually UPDATEs existing ones (count in metadata). New notifications → `renotify: true`; updates → `renotify: false` (silent badge bump). Same push `tag` per creator+type causes browser to replace (not stack) notifications.
- [x] **Deployed all 4 Edge Functions** to project `ztxguiujzirburxpjujf` via `npx supabase functions deploy`.
- [x] **React build verified clean** after all changes (4.86s, no errors).

### Previously — Push Notifications Setup (Feb 22, 2026 — earlier)
- [x] **`notifications` schema** — Added `actor_id UUID`, `updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ`, trigger `trg_notifications_updated_at`, CHECK constraint updated with 4 new types (`professor_content`, `friend_content`, `group_content`, `system_announcement`), two new indexes (`idx_notifications_grouping` partial, `idx_notifications_updated_at`).
- [x] **`get_recent_notifications` RPC** — Rebuilt (DROP + CREATE): returns `actor_id` + `updated_at`, sorts by `updated_at DESC` so aggregated notifications bubble to top.
- [x] **`get_recent_activity_feed` RPC** — Added SQL grouping by `(creator_id, creator_name, creator_role, content_type, DATE(created_at))`. Added `count INTEGER` and `subject TEXT` columns. Fixed missing subjects JOIN (subject was always blank). Verified: 59 professor uploads correctly grouped into 2 rows (37 + 22).
- [x] **`useNotifications.js`** — Added UPDATE Realtime subscription alongside existing INSERT subscription. On UPDATE calls `fetchNotifications()` to re-sort by `updated_at DESC`. Does not increment `unreadCount` (row was already unread).
- [x] **`ActivityFeed.jsx`** — Grouped rendering (`count > 1` → "30 notes added", `"View 30"` button). Fixed long-standing bug: was checking `content_type === 'deck'` but RPC returns `'flashcard_deck'`. Subject hidden for grouped rows. Author-filtered navigation for grouped clicks.
- [x] **`push_subscriptions` table** — Created with RLS, UNIQUE(user_id, endpoint), partial index on `is_active = true`.
- [x] **`push_notification_preferences` table** — Created with RLS, one row per user, all boolean prefs default `true`.
- [x] **Supabase CLI** — Installed via `npm install supabase --save-dev`, linked to project, initialized. VAPID keys generated via `npx web-push generate-vapid-keys`. Secrets set: `VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY`, `VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY`, `VAPID_SUBJECT=mailto:recall@moreclassescommerce.com`.
- [x] **`.env.local`** — `VITE_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY` added.

### Phase A: Professor Multi-Course — Teaching Areas + Course Context Switcher (Feb 21, 2026)
- [x] **`profile_courses` table** — Junction table linking users to multiple disciplines. `is_primary` flag, `UNIQUE(user_id, discipline_id)`, full RLS, two indexes. Additive to `profiles.course_level` (backward compat preserved).
- [x] **Backfill** — One-time migration seeds `profile_courses` from existing `profiles.course_level` for all professors/admins/super_admins.
- [x] **`CourseContext.jsx`** (NEW) — React context that fetches `profile_courses`, manages `activeCourse` session state, exposes `addCourse`, `removeCourse`, `setPrimaryCourse`. `setPrimaryCourse` syncs `profiles.course_level` atomically for backward compat.
- [x] **`CourseSwitcher.jsx`** (NEW) — Compact indigo pill dropdown in the nav bar (desktop: right section; mobile: Course Context section in hamburger sheet). Session-only, no DB write. Renders only when `isContentCreator && teachingCourses.length >= 2`.
- [x] **`App.jsx`** — Wrapped with `<CourseContextProvider>` inside `<AuthProvider>`.
- [x] **`NavDesktop.jsx`** — CourseSwitcher added to right icon section.
- [x] **`NavMobile.jsx`** — Course Context section added to sheet (tappable rows, flat list, no nested dropdowns).
- [x] **`ProfileSettings.jsx`** — "My Teaching Areas" card added (visible to professor/admin/super_admin). Add course from disciplines dropdown, set primary (star button), remove (X button, disabled for primary). Disciplines fetched from DB — always up to date.
- [x] **`AuthorProfile.jsx`** — Profile header now shows all teaching courses as indigo chips (from updated RPC). Falls back to single `course_level` for students.
- [x] **`Dashboard.jsx`** — Class stats use `activeCourse` from context. Reactive `useEffect` re-fetches class stats when professor switches course (initial mount skipped via `useRef`).
- [x] **Updated `get_author_profile()` RPC** — Added `teaching_courses` JSON array (primary first). All existing keys unchanged. SQL provided in chat.

### SQL Execution Order (run in Supabase SQL Editor — SQL provided in chat)
1. Diagnostic: verify CA Foundation/Inter/Final are `is_active = TRUE`
2. Create `profile_courses` table + RLS + indexes
3. Backfill from `profiles.course_level` for professors/admins/super_admins
4. `CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_author_profile(...)` — adds `teaching_courses` key

### UX: Consistent Notes → Flashcards Ordering Across Dashboard (Feb 21, 2026)
- [x] **Issue:** Quick Actions section had Notes → Flashcards for browse items, but then Flashcards → Notes for create items (Create Flashcard before Upload Note), inconsistent with all other sections
- [x] **Fix:** Swapped "Create Flashcard" and "Upload Note" cards in Quick Actions so the order is now: Browse Notes → Browse Flashcards → **Upload Note → Create Flashcard**
- [x] All sections now follow Notes-first order for consistency: Create Menu (nav), Quick Actions, My Contributions
- [x] Study Menu intentionally keeps Flashcards-first — see Active Decisions for rationale
- [x] No database changes — frontend-only fix in `Dashboard.jsx`

### Fix: Private Badges Showing on Author Profile Page (Feb 21, 2026)
- [x] **Bug:** Badges marked private in My Achievements were still visible on the Author Profile page (own + others' profiles)
- [x] **Root Cause:** `AuthorProfile.jsx` rendered `badges.map(...)` over all badges returned by `get_author_profile` RPC. For own profile the RPC returns ALL badges (including private); the old code only added a 🔒 icon but never hid the badge.
- [x] **Fix:** Computed `publicBadges = badges.filter(b => b.is_public !== false)` and replaced `badges.map` with `publicBadges.map`. Removed the now-redundant EyeOff indicator inside badge pills.
- [x] No database changes — frontend-only fix in `AuthorProfile.jsx`
- [x] Privacy now consistent across the full app: My Achievements = manage privacy; Author Page = public-only view

### Phase 1F - Extended Badge System with Performance Optimizations (Feb 21, 2026)
- [x] **Scalability fix:** Created `user_stats` table with integer counters — badge checks now O(1) instead of O(n) COUNT(*). Prevents bulk upload crash.
- [x] **Counter triggers:** 5 new triggers (`trg_aaa_counter_*`) on notes/flashcards/reviews/upvotes/friendships — alphabetically before badge triggers.
- [x] **13 new badges:** prolific_writer, deck_builder, subject_expert, first_steps, committed_learner, monthly_master, early_bird, century_club, review_veteran, social_learner, community_pillar, helpful_peer, pioneer.
- [x] **Timezone support:** Night Owl + Early Bird use `profiles.timezone` (already existed). No IST hardcoding.
- [x] **Race condition fix:** `award_badge` uses `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` — safe for concurrent calls.
- [x] **Default privacy:** night_owl and early_bird are private by default in updated `award_badge`.
- [x] **Pioneer badge:** Awarded via profile INSERT trigger for new users + backfill for all existing users.
- [x] **Friendship trigger:** `trg_badge_friendship` on friendships UPDATE for social badges.
- [x] **Frontend — BadgeIcon.jsx:** Added 13 new icon mappings (FileText, Layers, GraduationCap, Footprints, CalendarCheck, CalendarRange, Sunrise, Award, Medal, Users, HeartHandshake, ThumbsUp, Flag).
- [x] **Frontend — MyAchievements.jsx:** Added `special` category, replaced 5 separate COUNT queries with single `user_stats` read + streak call.
- [x] SQL scripts in `docs/sql/phase1f/` (6 files, run in order 01→06).

### SQL Execution Order
1. `01_schema.sql` — Create user_stats table + RLS + initialize rows
2. `05_award_badge.sql` — Update award_badge (badge triggers depend on it)
3. `02_counter_triggers.sql` — Counter trigger functions + triggers
4. `03_badge_definitions.sql` — Insert 13 new badge definitions
5. `04_badge_triggers.sql` — Updated badge trigger functions + triggers
6. `06_backfill.sql` — Populate user_stats + award retroactive badges

### Fix: Content Type Selector Missing on Upload Note (Feb 20, 2026)
- [x] **Bug:** Content Type buttons (Text, Table, Math, Diagram, Mixed) were only shown in Edit Note, not in Upload Note
- [x] **Fix:** Added Content Type selector to the "Note Details" card in `NoteUpload.jsx`, after the Description field
- [x] `contentType` state already existed and was already saved to DB — only the UI was missing
- [x] No database changes — frontend-only fix

### Landing Page Stats — Total Counts + Visibility Fix (Feb 20, 2026)
- [x] **Hero 4-stat grid:** Now shows true platform-wide totals (1383 flashcards, 38 notes) via `get_platform_stats()` SECURITY DEFINER RPC — bypasses RLS so unauthenticated visitors see real counts, not just public content
- [x] **Educator section:** Keeps public-only counts (458 flashcards, 34 notes) so new users see what they can actually browse. Relabeled "Flashcards to Browse" and "Notes to Browse"
- [x] **Hero social proof line:** Updated from "X+ items shared" → "X+ items created"
- [x] **Bug fix:** Public queries were using legacy `is_public = true` column — changed to `visibility = 'public'`
- [x] **MUST RUN SQL:** `get_platform_stats()` function in Supabase SQL Editor (see changelog for full SQL)

### Fix: Activity Feed "View" Button UUID Error (Feb 20, 2026)
- [x] **Bug:** Clicking "View" on a note in the Recent Activity section caused "Page Not Found" with error "Invalid input syntax for type uuid: 'undefined'"
- [x] **Root Cause:** `ActivityFeed.jsx` referenced `activity.content_id` but the `get_recent_activity_feed` RPC returns the UUID as `id` (consistent with all other RPCs). `activity.content_id` was always `undefined`, producing the URL `/dashboard/notes/undefined`.
- [x] **Fix:** Changed `activity.content_id` → `activity.id` in both the `handleActivityClick` navigate call and the React `key` prop
- [x] No database changes — frontend-only fix in `ActivityFeed.jsx`

### Fix: card_count Double-Counting — Full Resolution (Feb 24, 2026)
- [x] **True Root Cause (confirmed via trigger audit):** `trigger_update_deck_card_count` was already in the DB and correctly maintaining `card_count`. The frontend was ALSO manually incrementing it — so every card creation fired twice: once from the trigger, once from the app code. That was the original 2x bug.
- [x] **Feb 12 mis-fix:** Removed frontend increment (correct) but added a second DB trigger `flashcards_count_trigger` (redundant) — simply replaced app+trigger with trigger+trigger. Still 2x.
- [x] **Feb 24 final fix:** Dropped `flashcards_count_trigger`. Only `trigger_update_deck_card_count` remains — the original trigger that was always correct. Data recalculated via SQL.
- [x] **Frontend state:** `FlashcardCreate.jsx` has no manual `card_count` logic (correct — stays as-is). New decks insert with `card_count: 0`; trigger maintains it automatically.
- [x] **Lesson:** Always audit existing triggers before adding new ones (`SELECT trigger_name FROM information_schema.triggers WHERE event_object_table = 'flashcards'`).

### Fix: Flashcard Deck Names in Share Content Dialog (Feb 9, 2026)
- [x] **Fixed:** Share Content dialog showed "Flashcard Deck" for all decks instead of actual subject/topic names
- [x] Root cause: `subject_id` and `topic_id` were not included in the Supabase select query, so name lookups always failed
- [x] Added `subject_id, topic_id` to flashcard_decks query in `fetchUserContent()`
- [x] Added topic name lookup (fetches from `topics` table, same pattern as subjects)
- [x] Added `display_topic` field using `custom_topic || topicsMap[topic_id]`
- [x] Decks now show as "Subject - Topic" (e.g., "Auditing & Ethics - Audit of Items of Financial Statements")
- [x] No database changes — frontend-only fix

### Dependent Subject Dropdowns + Skipped Duplicates Report (Feb 9, 2026)
- [x] **FlashcardCreate + NoteUpload:** Subject dropdown now filters by selected course (`discipline_id`)
- [x] Disciplines loaded on mount; course name matched to discipline for subject filtering
- [x] Subject & topic selections reset when course changes (prevents stale cross-course selections)
- [x] Custom courses (no discipline match) show all subjects as fallback
- [x] **Fixed:** `description` column removed from topics insert/select — column doesn't exist in DB
- [x] **Fixed:** `sort_order` → `order_num` for all subjects/topics DB queries (same as disciplines)
- [x] **BulkUploadTopics:** Skipped duplicates now listed by name (`Subject → Topic`) in success report
- [x] DATABASE_SCHEMA.md updated for all 3 structure tables (disciplines, subjects, topics) with verified live DB columns
- [x] Build verified clean

### Bulk Upload QA Refinements + Disciplines Fix (Feb 9, 2026)
- [x] Removed forced download gate — all stepper steps freely clickable (returning users skip to Step 2)
- [x] Added first-timer nudge (amber Info box in Step 2 when Step 1 not done) on both pages
- [x] Step 3 shows contextual amber nudge when prerequisites missing (links back to relevant step)
- [x] **Fixed:** disciplines queries now use correct column names (`is_active`, `order_num` — NOT `sort_order`)
- [x] **Fixed:** Create New Course insert now includes required `code` column (auto-generated from name)
- [x] BulkUploadTopics: Added `[+ New Course]` inline form next to course dropdown
- [x] Course creation: Title Case enforcement + case-insensitive duplicate check + DB unique constraint catch
- [x] BulkUploadTopics: Added `subject_sort_order` and `sort_order` (topic) optional CSV columns
- [x] Sort logic: 0 = alphabetical fallback, explicit integers sorted first (sort_order ASC, name ASC)
- [x] Existing subjects with sort_order=0 get updated if CSV provides a non-zero value
- [x] Template changed to generic examples (language learning) instead of CA-specific
- [x] Current Entries download now includes sort_order columns and respects sort_order in output
- [x] CSV parser handles both `sort_order` and `topic_sort_order` header names
- [x] No database schema changes — uses existing sort_order columns on subjects/topics tables
- [x] **Note:** `disciplines` table uses `order_num` (not `sort_order`), has required `code` column. Schema verified against live DB.
- [x] Build verified clean

### Streamlined Bulk Upload Pages (Feb 9, 2026)
- [x] Created `BulkUploadFlashcards.jsx` — new stepper-based UI replacing old ProfessorTools 4-card layout
- [x] 3-step collapsible stepper: Download Files → Prepare & Select CSV → Upload
- [x] "Required columns" hint in Step 2 so users don't need to open template to check headers
- [x] Success state replaces stepper with "Upload More" / "View My Flashcards" buttons
- [x] Created `BulkUploadTopics.jsx` — admin-only page for bulk-adding subjects & topics to a course
- [x] Case-insensitive matching: "taxation" maps to existing "Taxation" (no duplicates)
- [x] Title Case enforcement: "income tax" → "Income Tax" for new entries
- [x] Duplicate detection: existing subject+topic combos are skipped automatically
- [x] Same stepper design pattern as flashcard bulk upload (consistent UX)
- [x] Route: `/dashboard/bulk-upload` (flashcards, all users), `/admin/bulk-upload-topics` (admin only)
- [x] `/professor/tools` now redirects to `/dashboard/bulk-upload`
- [x] Nav links updated: Bulk Upload visible to all users (was professor/admin only), "Manage Topics" link for admin/super_admin
- [x] FlashcardCreate.jsx "Try Bulk Upload" link updated to new route
- [x] All CSV parsing/upload logic preserved from original ProfessorTools
- [x] No database schema changes
- [x] Build verified clean

- [x] ProfileSettings course label changed to "Primary Course" (future multi-course prep)
- [x] Dashboard re-fetches after modal save for updated class stats
- [x] No database changes — reads existing `course_level` and `institution` columns
- [x] Build verified clean

### FindFriends Privacy Fix & Profile Settings Page (Feb 8, 2026)
- [x] Masked emails in FindFriends (`an***@gmail.com`) — cosmetic client-side masking, code comment added
- [x] Added institution + "Joined {year}" display on FindFriends cards for user disambiguation
- [x] Removed email from search filter (name-only search prevents email enumeration)
- [x] Created `ProfileSettings.jsx` — edit Full Name, Course Level, Institution
- [x] Institution field: dropdown (In-house / External / Other) with custom text input for "Other"
- [x] Input sanitization: trim whitespace + Title Case for custom institution names
- [x] Added `/dashboard/settings` route in App.jsx
- [x] Added Settings link with gear icon in ProfileDropdown.jsx (desktop) and NavMobile.jsx (mobile)
- [x] No database changes — uses existing `institution` column in profiles table
- [x] Build verified clean: `npx vite build` passes with no errors

### Flashcard Text-to-Speech / Read Aloud (Feb 8, 2026)
- [x] Created `useSpeech.js` hook — wraps Web Speech API with sentence chunking (Chrome 15-sec bug fix), localStorage for voice URI + speed
- [x] Created `SpeakButton.jsx` — reusable volume icon (Volume2/VolumeX) with pulse animation, hidden on unsupported browsers or empty text
- [x] Created `SpeechSettings.jsx` — popover with voice selector (grouped by language) + speed slider (0.5x–2.0x)
- [x] Integrated into `StudyMode.jsx` — volume icon on QUESTION side, volume icons on both QUESTION recap + ANSWER side after reveal, settings gear next to first volume icon
- [x] Auto-cancel speech on card advance, answer reveal, skip, suspend, reset, and component unmount
- [x] No database changes — pure client-side feature using browser-native Web Speech API
- [x] No new dependencies — zero external packages added

### File Structure Refactor — Pages out of Components (Feb 8, 2026)
- [x] Moved 9 page-level components from `src/components/` to `src/pages/` (enforces pages=routed, components=reusable convention)

## Active Decisions

| Decision | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Notes → Flashcards ordering standard | ✅ Decided | All sections use Notes-first order: Create Menu (nav), Quick Actions, My Contributions. Rationale: notes are foundational content; flashcards are derived from them. |
| Study Menu: Flashcards-first (intentional exception) | ✅ Decided | Study Menu keeps Flashcards first ("Review Flashcards" → "Browse Notes") because reviewing flashcards is the primary, active study action (spaced repetition core). Browsing notes is passive reference. The menu's purpose — active study — overrides the general Notes-first standard. |
| Grid/Grouped toggle on MyNotes | ✅ Implemented | localStorage persistence, matches MyFlashcards pattern |
| Collapsible groups on BrowseNotes | ✅ Implemented | Subject + Topic levels, chevron icons |
| Server-side author filtering | ✅ Implemented | RPC functions for performance & security |
| Split Author into Role + Author | ✅ Implemented | Better UX for filtering |
| Instant mark-as-read | ✅ Approved | Notifications marked read immediately on dropdown open |
| Modular navigation | ✅ Implemented | 6 component files for maintainability |
| Mobile Sheet (not menu) | ✅ Implemented | Smooth UX with slide-in animation |
| Study Groups Phase 1 | ✅ Implemented | Read-only sharing, 4-tier visibility, ON DELETE CASCADE |
| Group Invitation Flow | ✅ Implemented | Invite → Notify → Accept/Decline. No auto-add. Notification backend active. |

## Session Notes

### 2026-02-23 Session (Egress Optimisation — Architecture Learnings)
- **Root cause of migration timeouts:** `LIKE 'data:%'` on TOAST TEXT columns forces PostgreSQL to fully decompress every stored value before scanning — 167 rows × 570 KB = ~92 MB of decompression per query, even if zero rows match. This caused SQL Editor timeouts and Supabase API 504s.
- **Fix that worked:** Two-phase approach — `SELECT id WHERE column IS NOT NULL` (reads null-flag only, zero TOAST load) → loop and fetch one row at a time by primary key (one TOAST decompression per request).
- **`IS NOT NULL` is fast because** it only reads the null-flag stored in the heap tuple; it never touches the TOAST table at all.
- **Supabase billing cycle throttling:** When monthly egress (DB + Storage) exceeds 5 GB, Supabase throttles DB connections. Even `SELECT COUNT(*)` queries with `IS NOT NULL` hung while the project was over-limit (15.5 GB vs 5 GB). Unblock = wait for billing cycle reset. No query tuning can help once throttled.
- **Disk IO Budget** is a separate Supabase quota from egress. Large failed LIKE queries that decompress 92 MB count against it. Expect warnings for ~1 hour after heavy failed queries; it self-recovers.
- **Migration component pattern confirmed:** React component with `@/lib/supabase` is the correct approach — Vite apps don't expose `supabase` as a browser global; console scripts fail silently.
- **Key lesson — "scale assumption failure":** We reasoned about operation *logic* correctly but never quantified bytes. Rule added: always run `pg_size_pretty(SUM(pg_column_size(col)))` before writing any migration. See `context.md` → "Data Migration Architecture Rules" for full checklist.
- **DB size result:** 154 MB → 36 MB (76% reduction) after 167 base64 images migrated to `flashcard-images` Storage bucket.

### 2026-02-08 Session (Flashcard Text-to-Speech)
- Created `useSpeech.js` hook using Web Speech API with sentence chunking to prevent Chrome/Edge 15-second TTS cutoff bug
- Text is split by sentence-ending punctuation (. ! ? \n) and spoken sequentially; fallback to full text if no punctuation
- Voice and speed preferences persisted to localStorage (`recall-tts-voice-uri`, `recall-tts-rate`)
- `SpeakButton` uses `e.stopPropagation()` (established pattern for nested clickable elements)
- `SpeechSettings` uses existing Radix Popover component with voice grouped by language code
- Voices loaded via `voiceschanged` event listener (Chrome loads voices async)
- Speech auto-cancels via `useEffect` on `[currentIndex, showAnswer]` — covers all card transitions
- No database changes needed — future language-per-deck feature would add `language` column to `flashcard_decks`
- Build verified clean: `npx vite build` passes with no errors

### 2026-02-08 Session (File Structure Refactor)
- Root cause: `/dashboard/browse-notes` bug from mismatched file name (`BrowseNotes.jsx`) vs route path (`/dashboard/notes`)
- Moved 9 page-level components from `src/components/` to `src/pages/` to enforce convention: pages=routed, components=reusable
- Fixed only route missing `/dashboard` prefix: `/notes/edit/:id` → `/dashboard/notes/edit/:id`
- Added `LegacyNoteEditRedirect` component for old bookmark compatibility
- Added route-to-file mapping comment (27 routes) in App.jsx for quick reference
- Deleted dead `components/notes/index.jsx` (old "Coming Soon" placeholder, never imported)
- Only 3 files needed import path updates: App.jsx, ReviewSession.jsx, NoteDetail.jsx
- All moved files use `@/` alias imports so internal imports didn't break
- `FlashcardCard.jsx` stays in `components/flashcards/` (reusable component, not a page)
- Empty directories removed: `components/notes/`, `components/admin/`, `components/professor/`
- Build verified clean: `npx vite build` passes with no errors

### 2026-02-06 Session (Group Invitation Flow + Notification Backend)
- Built full notification backend: `notifications` table + 5 RPCs + cleanup utility
- Added `status` ('invited'/'active') + `invited_by` columns to `study_group_members`
- Follows friendships table pattern (status column, not separate table)
- `invite_to_group()` now inserts as 'invited' and creates notification with JSONB metadata
- Accept/decline RPCs auto-cleanup notifications via metadata->>'membership_id'
- All content-access RPCs updated with `AND status = 'active'` security filter

- BrowseNotes + ReviewFlashcards: merge group-shared content with existing visibility-filtered content
- Navigation: Groups link in desktop nav, Study Groups section in mobile sheet
- leave_group() promotes oldest member to admin if last admin leaves
- Content stores as 'private' visibility in DB when shared with groups (access via content_group_shares table)
- SQL files in docs/database/study-groups/ (01-08) must be run in Supabase SQL Editor

### 2026-02-06 Session (Card Suspension System)
- Added `status` TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'active' CHECK (active/suspended) to reviews table
- Added `skip_until` DATE DEFAULT NULL to reviews table
- Created 3 indexes: idx_reviews_status, idx_reviews_skip_until, idx_reviews_user_status_due (partial)
