## Landing Page Design Decisions (src/pages/Home.jsx)

These are locked design choices made with deliberate reasoning. Do NOT change without explicit user instruction.

### Hero Gradient Treatment (decided Mar 21, 2026)
- **`h1 "Recall"`** → gradient (`bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-600 to-purple-600 bg-clip-text text-transparent`)
- **`"The Revision Operating System."`** → solid dark (`text-gray-900 font-bold`)
- **Why:** The gradient is the attention magnet — eye goes to it first. Brand name must be what the user sees and remembers, not the tagline. Tagline in solid dark reads as confident and authoritative. Reversing this (tagline in gradient) pushes the product name into the background.

### Hero CTA Hierarchy (decided Mar 20, 2026)
- **Primary:** "Start free" → full gradient button (B2C)
- **Secondary:** "Get your institute on Recall" → text link below stats, after a horizontal divider (B2B)
- **Why:** B2C students find the page organically. B2B institute owners come via referral/direct outreach — they won't cold-convert from a hero CTA.

### Stat Labels (decided Mar 20, 2026)
- Grid shows "Flashcards" and "Notes" separately (not combined "Items Created")
- Hero pill 3 shows combined total as "flashcards & notes"
- **Why:** Showing combined total in pill then splitting in grid was confusing. Labels now make the relationship obvious.

## Bug Debugging Protocol

### For any bug involving a DB column with a wrong value (count, total, status)

**Phase 1 — Map all writers (do this BEFORE forming any hypothesis)**

```sql
-- 1. Who writes to this column directly?
SELECT trigger_name, event_manipulation, action_timing
FROM information_schema.triggers
WHERE event_object_table = '<table_name>'
ORDER BY trigger_name;

-- 2. What functions reference this column?
SELECT routine_name, routine_definition
FROM information_schema.routines
WHERE routine_definition ILIKE '%<column_name>%'
  AND routine_type = 'FUNCTION';
```

Also grep the frontend codebase for the column name before assuming it's DB-only.

**Phase 2 — Verify the data (confirm scope)**

```sql
-- Standard mismatch check pattern:
SELECT d.id, d.<stored_column>, COUNT(f.id) AS actual,
       d.<stored_column> - COUNT(f.id) AS discrepancy
FROM <parent_table> d
LEFT JOIN <child_table> f ON f.<fk> = d.id
GROUP BY d.id, d.<stored_column>
HAVING d.<stored_column> != COUNT(f.id)
ORDER BY discrepancy DESC;
```

**Phase 3 — State hypothesis explicitly, then prove it**

Write: *"Hypothesis: X is causing Y because Z. Proof needed: [specific query or test]."*
Do NOT document a root cause as confirmed until you have run a query or test that proves it.

**Phase 4 — Design fix with minimum new state**

- Prefer removing the wrong thing over adding a new thing
- If adding a DB object (trigger, function, index), re-run Phase 1 after to confirm no conflicts
- The safest fix for a stale counter is always: `UPDATE table SET col = (SELECT COUNT(*) ...)`

**Phase 5 — Verify after fix**

Re-run the Phase 2 mismatch query. If result is empty → fixed. Do not skip this.

### Lesson learned (Feb 2026 — card_count bug)

`trigger_update_deck_card_count` existed and was correct. Frontend was also incrementing `card_count` manually → 2x. First fix attempt removed frontend increment (correct) but added a second trigger (wrong) — still 2x. Issue recurred.

**Failure mode:** Phase 1 was skipped. Trigger audit was only run after the bug recurred a second time.

**Rule:** Never add a DB trigger without first running the trigger list query for that table.

## Study Groups + Invitation Flow + Notifications Backend (2026-02-06)

### Study Groups (Phase 1: Read-Only Sharing)

**Concept:** Users create groups, invite friends, share notes/flashcards with selected people.

#### 4-Tier Visibility Model
| Level | Who Can See |
|-------|-------------|
| **Private** | Only creator |
| **Study Groups** | Creator + group members (stored as 'private' in DB, accessed via content_group_shares) |
| **Friends** | Creator + accepted friends |
| **Public** | Everyone |

#### Database Tables (3 new)
- `study_groups` — Group metadata (name, description, creator). Creator can update/delete.
- `study_group_members` — Membership with roles (admin/member) + invitation status ('invited'/'active') + invited_by. UNIQUE(group_id, user_id). ON DELETE CASCADE from study_groups.
- `content_group_shares` — Links content (notes/decks) to groups. UNIQUE(group_id, content_type, content_id). ON DELETE CASCADE from study_groups (deleting group removes shares, NOT original content).

#### Invitation Flow (Consent-Based)
1. Admin clicks "Invite Members" → searches users → clicks "Invite"
2. `invite_to_group()` inserts with `status = 'invited'` + creates notification with JSONB metadata
3. Invited user sees notification in bell dropdown with inline Accept/Decline buttons
4. Invited user also sees amber "Pending Invitations" section on MyGroups page
5. Accept → `accept_group_invite()` updates status to 'active', marks notification read
6. Decline → `decline_group_invite()` marks notification read, hard DELETEs membership row
7. Admin can cancel pending invitations from GroupDetail members panel

#### Security Rules
- Only **active** members can view group content (`AND sgm.status = 'active'` in all content queries)
- Invited users CANNOT see shared notes/decks until they accept
- No email returned in any group RPC (privacy)
- Strict `IF NOT EXISTS` membership check with 'Access denied' exception
- All arrays use double COALESCE ensuring `[]` never `null`

### Notifications Backend

**Architecture:** `notifications` table was pre-existing (from Phase 1B). We added `title`, `metadata JSONB`, `is_read` columns + updated CHECK constraint to include `group_invite` type.

#### Notification Types (CHECK constraint)
`content_upvoted`, `badge_earned`, `friend_request`, `friend_accepted`, `friend_rejected`, `welcome`, `group_invite`

#### RPCs (6 SECURITY DEFINER functions)
1. `get_unread_notification_count(p_user_id)` → INTEGER
2. `get_recent_notifications(p_user_id, p_limit)` → TABLE (includes metadata JSONB)
3. `mark_notifications_read(p_user_id)` → VOID (mark all)
4. `mark_single_notification_read(p_notification_id)` → VOID
5. `delete_notification(p_notification_id)` → VOID
6. `cleanup_old_notifications()` → INTEGER (deletes > 60 days, for cron)

#### Realtime
- `notifications` table has Supabase Realtime enabled (Replication toggle in Dashboard)
- `useNotifications.js` hook subscribes to INSERT events filtered by `user_id`
- New notifications appear instantly in bell dropdown without page refresh

#### Group Invite Notification Metadata (JSONB)
```json
{
  "group_id": "uuid",
  "group_name": "Study Group Name",
  "inviter_id": "uuid",
  "inviter_name": "John Doe",
  "membership_id": "uuid"
}
```

### Study Group RPCs (14 SECURITY DEFINER functions)
1. `create_study_group(p_name, p_description)` — Creates group + adds creator as admin
2. `invite_to_group(p_group_id, p_user_id)` — Admin invites (status='invited' + notification)
3. `accept_group_invite(p_membership_id)` — User accepts, auto-marks notification read
4. `decline_group_invite(p_membership_id)` — User declines, hard DELETEs row
5. `get_pending_group_invites()` — Returns pending invitations for MyGroups page
6. `leave_group(p_group_id)` — Member leaves (promotes oldest if last admin, deletes group if last member)
7. `share_content_with_groups(p_content_type, p_content_id, p_group_ids)` — Multi-group share
8. `get_user_groups()` — Returns user's ACTIVE groups with member count and role
9. `get_group_shared_content(p_group_id)` — Returns shared notes and decks
10. `get_group_members(p_group_id)` — Returns active members (no email)
11. `get_group_detail(p_group_id)` — Returns group + active members + pending invitations + shared content (single call)
12. `get_browsable_notes()` — All visible notes (own + public + friends + group-shared, active members only)
13. `get_browsable_decks()` — Same for flashcard decks
14. `get_filtered_authors_for_notes/flashcards()` — Author search (pre-existing, not modified)

### Frontend Pages
- `MyGroups.jsx` — Group list + "Pending Invitations" section with Accept/Decline
- `CreateGroup.jsx` — Name + description form
- `GroupDetail.jsx` — Members panel (with pending section for admins), shared content, invite/share/remove dialogs

### Navigation
- Desktop: `Network` icon + "Groups" link in main nav
- Mobile: Study Groups section in hamburger sheet
- ActivityDropdown: group_invite notifications with inline Accept/Decline buttons

### SQL Files
All in `docs/database/study-groups/` (files 01-26):
- 01-08: Phase 1 schema + RLS + functions
- 09-12: RLS fix + server-side content fetching
- 13-14: Notifications table + RPCs

```

### Badge Definitions (Initial Set)

| Key | Name | Icon | Category | Threshold | Trigger |
|-----|------|------|----------|-----------|---------|
| digitalizer | Digitalizer | upload | content | 1 | notes INSERT |
| memory_architect | Memory Architect | brain | content | 10 | flashcards INSERT |

## Phase 1D: Upvote System (2026-01-24)

### New Database Tables

#### flashcard_decks
```
flashcard_decks
├── id (UUID, PK)
├── user_id (UUID, FK → profiles.id)
├── subject_id (UUID, FK → subjects.id, nullable)
├── custom_subject (TEXT, nullable)
├── topic_id (UUID, FK → topics.id, nullable)
├── custom_topic (TEXT, nullable)
├── target_course (TEXT)
├── visibility (TEXT: private/friends/public)
├── name (TEXT, optional custom name)
├── description (TEXT)
├── card_count (INTEGER, auto-updated by trigger)
├── upvote_count (INTEGER, auto-updated by trigger)
├── created_at (TIMESTAMP)
└── updated_at (TIMESTAMP)
```

### Modified Tables

#### upvotes (Polymorphic Design)
```
upvotes
├── id (UUID, PK)
├── user_id (UUID, FK → profiles.id) -- WHO upvoted
├── content_type (TEXT: 'note' | 'flashcard_deck') -- NEW
├── target_id (UUID) -- NEW: points to notes.id or flashcard_decks.id
├── note_id (UUID, nullable, deprecated - kept for migration)
└── created_at (TIMESTAMP)
└── UNIQUE(user_id, content_type, target_id)
```

#### flashcards (Added Column)
- `deck_id` (UUID, FK → flashcard_decks.id) - Links cards to their deck

### Database Functions
- `toggle_upvote(p_content_type, p_target_id)` - Toggle upvote with validation
- `get_upvote_details(p_content_type, p_target_id)` - Get upvoter names for creators
- `has_user_upvoted(p_content_type, p_target_id)` - Check if user upvoted
- `update_upvote_counts()` - Trigger function for auto-updating counts
- `update_deck_card_count()` - Trigger function for deck card counts

### RLS Policies

#### flashcard_decks
- SELECT: Own, public, friends (with friendship check), admin
- INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE: Own or admin

#### upvotes
- SELECT: All authenticated users (for counting)
- INSERT: Only on content user can view AND not own content
- DELETE: Own upvotes only

### Frontend Components

#### New: UpvoteButton.jsx (`src/components/ui/UpvoteButton.jsx`)
- Reusable toggle button for notes and flashcard_decks
- Optimistic UI updates
- Prevents self-upvoting
- Size variants: sm, md, lg

#### Modified Files
- `BrowseNotes.jsx` - Upvote button on note cards
- `ReviewFlashcards.jsx` - Upvote button on deck cards (queries flashcard_decks)
- `MyContributions.jsx` - Community Feedback section with upvoter names
- `NoteDetail.jsx` - Upvote button in header

### Upvote Rules
1. One upvote per user per content (enforced by UNIQUE constraint)
2. Cannot upvote own content (enforced by RLS + frontend)
3. Can only upvote content you can view (visibility rules apply)
4. Toggle behavior: click again to remove upvote
5. Creators see WHO upvoted; students see counts only
----
**Current state**

Recall is in production with 27 registered students and impressive early metrics: 542+ total reviews from top students. The platform features a complete tech stack (React, Supabase, Vercel) with a four-tier role system (super_admin, admin, professor, student), three-tier content visibility (Private/Friends/Public), and comprehensive spaced repetition using SuperMemo-2 methodology.

**DASHBOARD REDESIGN (2026-01-24):** Implemented Phase 1C with anonymous class statistics. New `AnonymousStats` component shows "You vs Class" comparison using Tailwind progress bars, class milestones (students studied today, 7-day streaks), with privacy-first design (min 5 users for averages, course-level filtering). SQL function `get_anonymous_class_stats()` uses SECURITY DEFINER to aggregate across users while respecting privacy. Quick Actions expanded to 4 buttons for better UX.

Recent development has focused on fixing the spaced repetition architecture, implementing proper review progress persistence, and adding subject-based review grouping. The platform successfully handles review data isolation per user, preventing schedule conflicts between students reviewing the same cards.


## Spaced Repetition & Timezone Standards

### Critical Bug Fix (2026-01-21)

#### Root Causes Identified
1. **Timezone Mismatch:** Using `toISOString()` (UTC) caused "Next Review Date" to be calculated as "Yesterday" for users in Western timezones (or late night in India), causing cards to reappear immediately.
2. **Architectural Conflict:** Progress was originally writing to `flashcards` table (Professor-owned), causing RLS failures.
3. **Logic Mismatch:** Dashboard counted "New Cards" as "Due", creating "All Caught Up" false positives when entering Review Session.

#### Enforced Technical Rules

**Date Handling (CRITICAL - NEVER VIOLATE):**
**Date Handling (CRITICAL - NEVER VIOLATE):**
- ❌ **NEVER** use `date.toISOString()` for user-facing date comparisons
- ❌ **NEVER** hardcode a specific timezone (e.g., `Asia/Kolkata`)
- ✅ **ALWAYS** use `toLocaleDateString('en-CA')` WITHOUT timezone parameter
- **Reason:** This uses the user's browser/device timezone automatically, works globally for all users

**Example (Correct Implementation):**
```javascript
// ============================================================
// HELPER: Format date as YYYY-MM-DD in user's LOCAL timezone
// Using 'en-CA' locale gives us ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD) which
// allows correct string comparison for dates.
// ============================================================
const formatLocalDate = (date) => {
  return new Date(date).toLocaleDateString('en-CA');
};

// ✅ CORRECT: Get today in user's local timezone
const today = formatLocalDate(new Date());  // e.g., "2026-01-30"

// ✅ CORRECT: Get yesterday in user's local timezone
const yesterdayDate = new Date();
yesterdayDate.setDate(yesterdayDate.getDate() - 1);
const yesterday = formatLocalDate(yesterdayDate);

// ✅ CORRECT: Convert database timestamp to user's local date
const reviewDate = formatLocalDate(review.created_at);

// ❌ WRONG: UTC conversion
const wrong = new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0];
// Problem: May return different date than user's calendar date

// ❌ WRONG: Hardcoded timezone
const alsoWrong = new Date().toLocaleDateString('en-CA', { timeZone: 'Asia/Kolkata' });
// Problem: Only works for users in India

Why 'en-CA' locale?

Canadian English formats dates as YYYY-MM-DD (ISO format)
This format allows correct string comparison ("2026-01-30" > "2026-01-29")
Works for sorting and database queries
NOT about Canada - just about the date format!

**Database Operations (StudyMode.jsx):**
- **Source of Truth:** Student progress stored EXCLUSIVELY in `reviews` table
- **Explicit Logic:** Use explicit `SELECT → IF exists UPDATE → ELSE INSERT` flow
- **Reason:** Do not use single-command atomic UPSERTs to ensure code readability and stability

**Dashboard & Review Logic:**
- **Definition of "Due":** A card is due ONLY if it exists in `reviews` table AND `next_review_date <= Today` (Local)
- **Separation:** "New Cards" (never studied) are excluded from Dashboard count
- **Access:** New cards accessible via Library (ReviewFlashcards.jsx), not Review Session

#### Files Modified
- `src/components/flashcards/StudyMode.jsx` - Fixed date math + explicit DB logic
- `src/pages/dashboard/Study/ReviewSession.jsx` - Query reviews table + local date comparison
- `src/pages/Dashboard.jsx` - Count reviews table + local date comparison

#### Impact
- ✅ Cards no longer reappear immediately after review
- ✅ Timezone-independent behavior (works globally)
- ✅ Accurate "Reviews Due" count on Dashboard
- ✅ Student progress saves reliably regardless of card ownership

## User Timezone Storage (2026-01-30)

### Overview
User's IANA timezone is stored in `profiles.timezone` and auto-synced from browser on every login.

### Database Changes
- **New Column:** `profiles.timezone` (TEXT, default 'Asia/Kolkata')
- **Updated Functions:**
  - `log_review_activity()` - Uses stored timezone for local date/hour
  - `check_night_owl_badge()` - Checks 11 PM - 4 AM in user's local time
  - `get_user_streak()` - Calculates streak based on user's local days
  - `get_anonymous_class_stats()` - Uses per-user timezone for "studied today"

### Frontend Changes
- **AuthContext.jsx:** New `updateUserTimezone()` helper
  - Runs on session init, `SIGNED_IN` event, and manual sign in
  - Detects browser timezone via `Intl.DateTimeFormat().resolvedOptions().timeZone`
  - Only updates if timezone changed (optimization)
  - Sets timezone on new user signup

### How It Works

User logs in → Browser timezone detected → Compared with profiles.timezone
→ If different, UPDATE profiles SET timezone = 'America/New_York'
→ All DB functions now use this for local time calculations


### Benefits
- Night Owl badge works correctly for users worldwide
- Streak calculations respect user's local midnight
- "Studied today" is accurate regardless of server timezone
- Timezone auto-updates if user travels

## Four-Tier Visibility System

| Level | Who Can See |
|-------|-------------|
| **Private** | Only creator |
| **Study Groups** | Creator + active group members (stored as 'private', accessed via content_group_shares) |
| **Friends** | Creator + accepted friends |
| **Public** | Everyone |

Applied to: Notes, Flashcards

## Spaced Repetition Algorithm (SuperMemo-2)

```javascript
// Intervals based on quality score
Hard (quality=1)   → next_review = NOW + 1 day
Medium (quality=3) → next_review = NOW + 3 days
Easy (quality=5)   → next_review = NOW + 7 days

// Scheduling uses UTC midnight
next_review.setUTCHours(0, 0, 0, 0)
```

**Key Fields on flashcards table:**
- `next_review`: When card is due (TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE, NOT NULL)
- `interval`: Days until next review (INTEGER)
- `ease_factor`: Difficulty multiplier (NUMERIC, DEFAULT 2.5)
- `repetitions`: Times reviewed (INTEGER)

---

## Row Level Security (RLS) Policies

### flashcards table (RLS ENABLED)
```sql
-- Users can view their own flashcards
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own flashcards" ON flashcards
FOR SELECT USING (user_id = auth.uid());

-- Users can view public flashcards
CREATE POLICY "Users can view public flashcards" ON flashcards
FOR SELECT USING (visibility = 'public');

-- Users can view friends' flashcards (visibility='friends')
CREATE POLICY "Users can view friends flashcards" ON flashcards
FOR SELECT USING (
  visibility = 'friends' AND
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM friendships
    WHERE status = 'accepted'
    AND ((user_id = auth.uid() AND friend_id = flashcards.user_id)
         OR (friend_id = auth.uid() AND user_id = flashcards.user_id))
  )
);
```

### friendships table (RLS ENABLED)
```sql
-- Users can view their own friendships
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own friendships" ON friendships
FOR SELECT USING (user_id = auth.uid() OR friend_id = auth.uid());
```

## Critical Rules & Patterns

### 1. Two-Tier Content Model
- **User's Enrollment** (`profiles.course_level`): What they're studying
- **Content's Target** (`notes.target_course`, `flashcards.target_course`): Who it's for
- These are INDEPENDENT - professors can create content for any course

### 2. Batch Tracking for Bulk Uploads
- All cards from one CSV get same `batch_id`
- Manual cards get unique `batch_id`
- Groups survive visibility changes

### 3. Attribution System
- `creator_id`: WHO uploaded (for UI display)
- `content_creator_id`: WHO gets revenue (for Vivitsu partnership)

### 4. UTC Midnight Scheduling
- All `next_review` times set to midnight UTC
- Use `setHours(0,0,0,0)` not `setHours()`

### 5. eslint-disable Pattern for useEffect
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  // fetch logic
}, [dependency]);
// eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps

### 6. Always use @/ for imports.
```

### 6. Query Pattern for User Attribution
```javascript
// Fetch separately, merge in JS (more reliable than PostgREST joins)
const notes = await fetchNotes();
const profiles = await fetchProfiles(userIds);
const merged = notes.map(n => ({...n, user: profiles.find(p => p.id === n.user_id)}));
```

### 7. Data Migration Architecture Rules (CRITICAL — learned Feb 2026)

These rules exist because a migration of 167 flashcard images (110 MB base64 → Storage) caused repeated timeouts and billing quota exhaustion before succeeding. Root cause: nobody quantified data volume before writing the migration query.

#### Pre-Migration Checklist (run BEFORE writing any migration)

**Step 1: Measure the data budget**
```sql
-- [DIAGNOSTIC] Data size before migration
-- Run this FIRST. Know your numbers before writing the migration.
SELECT
  COUNT(*) AS row_count,
  pg_size_pretty(SUM(pg_column_size(the_column))) AS total_column_size,
  pg_size_pretty(AVG(pg_column_size(the_column))::BIGINT) AS avg_per_row
FROM your_table
WHERE the_column IS NOT NULL;
```
If `total_column_size > 10 MB`, treat the migration as high-risk — plan for one-row-at-a-time processing.

**Step 2: Identify TOAST columns**
Any TEXT or JSONB column where individual values exceed ~2 KB is stored in PostgreSQL TOAST (The Oversized-Attribute Storage Technique). TOAST values are:
- Stored compressed in a separate internal table
- **NOT** loaded unless the column is explicitly selected
- **Fully decompressed** when used in a LIKE / regex pattern match — even for non-matching rows

| Filter type | TOAST behaviour | Safe for large data? |
|---|---|---|
| `IS NOT NULL` | Reads null-flag only (heap tuple) — TOAST never touched | ✅ Yes |
| `= 'exact_value'` | Decompresses only matching rows | ✅ Yes (if few matches) |
| `LIKE 'data:%'` | Decompresses **every row** to scan content | ❌ No |
| `SELECT *` | Decompresses all TOAST columns for every selected row | ❌ No for bulk |

**Step 3: Plan a two-phase fetch — never one big query**
```
Phase 1: SELECT id WHERE column IS NOT NULL  ← returns UUID list only, zero TOAST loading
Phase 2: For each id → fetch one row at a time  ← one TOAST decompression per round-trip
```
Never use `SELECT *` or `LIKE` patterns on TOAST columns in bulk. Always fetch IDs first, then rows individually.

#### Migration Component Pattern (React)
- ❌ **Never** run migrations from the browser console (Vite apps don't expose `supabase` as a global)
- ✅ **Always** create a temporary `src/pages/admin/MigrateXxx.jsx` React component with `@/lib/supabase` import
- ✅ Show a progress counter + per-item log (color-coded ✅/❌) so you can monitor without guessing
- ✅ Make it safe to re-run (`upsert: true` on uploads, skip already-migrated rows)
- ✅ Delete the component and its route from `App.jsx` immediately after migration is confirmed complete

#### Supabase Free Plan Limits to Watch
| Resource | Limit | Impact when exceeded |
|---|---|---|
| Database size | 500 MB | Writes blocked |
| Egress (DB + Storage) | 5 GB / month | DB connections throttled |
| Disk IO Budget | Separate quota | Queries slow/fail |

If you see "EXCEEDING USAGE LIMITS" banner in Supabase Dashboard → billing cycle reset date is your unblock date. Do not retry large queries until the cycle resets.
